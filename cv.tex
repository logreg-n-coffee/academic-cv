& \indent \parbox{5.9in}{
- Interviewed a non-native English speaker (N = 1) and collected the speech data by recording the interview with a semi-structured protocol \\
- Comprehensively analyzed the speech data at the levels of phonetics and phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics/lexicon, with the main features listed below: \\
--- Phonetics and phonology: stress, rhythm, accuracy of vowels, consonants (with accurate transcription using IPA when necessary) \\
--- Morphology: inflectional and derivational morphemes \\
--- Syntax: irregular past, comparative and superlative degrees of an adjective, third-person singular form \\
--- Semantics and word choice: involving correct usage of words \\
- Described the characteristics of the speaker's speech and summarized the speaker's strengths and weaknesses \\
- From the perspective of L1-L2 transfer, analyzed the features of the speaker's speech and summarized the features that were rooted in the speaker's first language (L1) and the ones that were independent of the speaker's L1 \\
- Provided a summary of potential instructional priorities on improving the speaker's English speaking
